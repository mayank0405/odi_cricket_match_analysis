## Problem Statement

As an avid follower of cricket, I always wanted to do some analysis on Cricket. Luckily, I found out a very useful dataset on which I could do some SQL analysis. 

It would be interesting to know about...

- Which country has hosted most ODI matches since its inception?
- How many matches toss winner has won and lost. 
- What kind of batting parternships have happened over the years.

## Dataset Used

- odi_Fow_Card.csv

- odi_Batting_Card.csv

- odi_Bowling_Card.csv

- odi_Matches_Data.csv

- odi_Partnership_Card.csv

- players_info.csv
