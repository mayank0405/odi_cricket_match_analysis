‚ùó **Insight-** In the above 6 queries, we have extracted the column name, ordinal position and data type of the columns of each table. We do it using **_INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS_**.

### :pushpin: Total number of matches played:
````sql
SELECT  COUNT(*)  AS  number_of_matches
FROM  `sports.matches`;
````

**_Results_**
| number_of_matches |
|-------------------|
| 4686              |


‚ùó **Insight-** This query counts the number of matches played. This is done using the **_count_** function. Since all matches as unique and every record is a record of one match so, we use **_count(*)_**.

### :pushpin: Time Range: 
````sql
SELECT
	MIN(EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM  Match_Date))  AS  First_Year,
	MAX(EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM  Match_Date))  AS  Last_Year
FROM  `sports.matches`
WHERE  EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM  Match_Date)  IS  NOT  NULL;
````

**_Results_**
| First_Year | Last_Year |
|------------|-----------|
| 1971       | 2023      |

‚ùó **Insight-**  Given the huge period of time in the dataset we should know the first year when ODI matches started and the latest year ODI match happened.

### :pushpin: Number of matches played each year:
````sql
SELECT
	EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM  Match_Date)  AS  Year,
	COUNT(Match_ID)  AS  number_of_matches
FROM  `sports.matches`
GROUP  BY  1
ORDER  BY  1
LIMIT  5;
````

**_Results_**

| Year | number_of_matches |
|------|-------------------|
| 1    |                   |
| 1971 | 1                 |
| 1972 | 3                 |
| 1973 | 5                 |
| 1974 | 6                 |


‚ùó **Insight-** Here we try to find out the number of matches played every year from 1971. Since there are many records so we use **_limit 5_** to show only first 5 records. Also there is on _NULL_ value, this means that we don‚Äôt have data for that record.

### :pushpin: Find the number of matches played in each country:
````sql
SELECT
	Match_Venue__Country_,
	COUNT(Match_ID)  AS  number_of_matches_played
FROM  `sports.matches`
GROUP  BY  1
ORDER  BY  2  DESC
LIMIT  5;
````

**_Results_**

| Match_Venue__Country_ | number_of_matches_played |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Australia             | 635                      |
| India                 | 507                      |
| England               | 500                      |
| United Arab Emirates  | 380                      |
| South Africa          | 378                      |

‚ùó **Insight-**  Next, we find out how many matches were held in each country since the inception of ODI Cricket. This gives us an understanding of how much ODI Cricket is popular in a given country. For this we use the  **_GROUP BY_**  function.

### :pushpin: Which venue hosted the maximum number of matches in the year 2016:
````sql
SELECT
	Match_Venue__City_,
	COUNT(Match_ID)  AS  number_of_matches
FROM  `sports.matches`
WHERE  EXTRACT(YEAR  FROM  Match_Date) = 2016
GROUP  BY  1
ORDER  BY  2  DESC
LIMIT  5;
````

**_Results_**

| Match_Venue__City_ | number_of_matches |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Edinburgh          | 6                 |
| Dhaka              | 5                 |
| Harare             | 5                 |
| Sharjah            | 5                 |
| Bulawayo           | 5                 |

‚ùó **Insight-** In order to find out the number of matches held in each venue in the world we do the same process as done before but here we do it only for the year 2016. We put the condition in the where clause using **_extract_** function.

### :pushpin: Find the number of tied matches:
````sql
SELECT  COUNT(Match_ID)  AS  number_of_matches
FROM  `sports.matches`
WHERE  Match_Result_Text = 'Match tied';
````

**_Results_**
| number_of_matches |
|-------------------|
| 36                |

‚ùó **Insight-**  Here we try to find out the number of tied matches since the starting of ODI cricket. This is a very fascinating thing that in so many matches played since 1971 only 36 matches have been tied.

### :pushpin: What is the number of matches won and lost by teams who won the toss:
````sql
SELECT
	SUM(CASE  WHEN  Toss_Winner = Match_Winner  THEN  1  END)  AS  matches_won,
	SUM(CASE  WHEN  Toss_Winner <> Match_Winner  THEN  1  END)  AS  matches_lost
FROM  `sports.matches`
WHERE  Toss_Winner  IS  NOT  NULL  AND  Match_Winner  IS  NOT  NULL;
````

**_Results_**

| matches_won | matches_lost |
|-------------|--------------|
| 2251        | 2227         |

‚ùó  **Insight-** Here we have to find how many matches were won and lost by the team that won coin toss. For that we use the **_CASE_** to do the condition checking and then use the **_SUM()_** function to find the total number of matches.

### :pushpin: Find the number of matches in which players made their debut:
````sql
SELECT  COUNT(LENGTH(Debut_Players))  AS  number_of_matches
FROM  `sports.matches`
WHERE  LENGTH(Debut_Players)  >  2;
````

**_Results_**

| number_of_matches |
|-------------------|
| 1575              |

‚ùó **Insight-** Here we use the **_count_** and **_length_** function to find out in how many ODI matches, players made their debut. We **_use length(Debut_Players) > 2_** because values stored in **_Debut_Players_** are string and if anyone has made debut, his id stored as string. So, if there are any values in debut_players, their length must be greater than 2 because if there is no one then the value is ‚Äò[]‚Äô.

### :pushpin: During which innings maximum number of fowls happened:
````sql
SELECT
	innings,
	COUNT(Match_ID)  AS  number_of_fowls
FROM  `sports.fowl`
GROUP  BY  innings
ORDER  BY  2  DESC;
````

**_Results_**

| innings | number_of_fowls |
|---------|-----------------|
| 1       | 36366           |
| 2       | 30754           |

‚ùó **Insight-**  Here we find out the number of fowls happened in each innings of all the match and then order by number_of_fowls. This shows that most fowls happened during first innings.

### :pushpin: Find the details of the matches during which highest number of runs were scored by both the teams:
````sql
WITH  cte  AS  (
		SELECT  *
		FROM  `sports.batting`
		WHERE
			team  IS  NOT  NULL
			AND  batsman  IS  NOT  NULL
			AND  runs  IS  NOT  NULL
			AND  balls  IS  NOT  NULL
			AND  fours  IS  NOT  NULL

‚ùó **Insight-**  We have to find out which ODI Series is the most popular. This will help us in generating more income for the countries since it will tell us which kind of tournaments should we popularize more. As we did in the previous query, we use **_windows function_** and **_INNER JOIN_** on _Match_ID_. And then in the _SELECT_ clause we use **_COUNT()_** function. From this analysis we find out that World Cup Super League 2 is the most popular with 124 matches.

| 53016.0  | Oman    | World Cup League 2  - 2019 (2019-2023) | 1098.0 |

‚ùó **Insight-**  Here we have to find the batsman who scored the highest number of runs from each team in a given series. For this we use the same previous methods but use **_SUM_** function over runs.

### :pushpin: During which series the bowlers gave their best performance:
````sql
SELECT
    m.Series_Name,
    ROUND(AVG(s.economy), 2) AS average_economy
FROM `sports.bowling` s
INNER JOIN `sports.matches` m ON s.Match_ID = m.Match_ID

| Pakistan tour of England  - 1978 (1978)       | 3.07            |
| India tour of Sri Lanka  - 2006 (2006)        | 3.1             |

‚ùó **Insight-**  In order to find that the bowlers gave their best performance, we have to look at the economy rate. Economy in cricket means average number of runs conceded by bowlers per over. If we find the average economy of bowlers for each series and then order by **average_economy** to get the lowest average. From this we find out that bowlers were most economical during England Tour of Ireland in 2015 with an exceptional economy of 2.85.

### :pushpin: Find the series in year 2023 where the total number of wickets taken is greater than 100:

‚ùó **Insight-**  Here it was asked to find out the series where the total number of wickets taken are greater than 100. So, for that condition, we have used HAVING function to see whether the sum is greater than 100 or not.

### :pushpin: What is the trend in number of fowls happened in matches from 2010 to 2020:

| 2011 | 2135        | 10   |
| 2019 | 2136        | 11   |

‚ùó **Insight-**  We have to find out the trend in number of fowls over a given period of time. For that we use the **_row_number()_** function to see whether it gives us some ranking in the matches with most number of fowls. Unfortunately, even though we get a ranking on the basis of number of matches with fowls we still don‚Äôt see a trend or a pattern. It is very uneven so, we can‚Äôt say anything about the trend.

‚ùó **Insight-** Here we have to find out the bowlers who were economical during a given series. One thing to note here is that a batsman who are part time bowlers can also have very good statistics. So, we will also use number of wickets taken and economy rate to find out the players who are only bowlers. We order them by number of wickets in **_descending_** order and then economy in **_ascending_** to find out the bowler with best numbers in a given series. This helps us in finding which countries have the best bowlers.
